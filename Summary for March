What I read:

0. DP18 paper on lattice decoding.
1. lectures 1-5, 9 from the course by Ducas and Dadush, lecture 6 up to part 3.
2. lectures 1-3, 9 from the course by Regev
3. http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mathclub/Media/mult-grp-cyclic-az.pdf - Multiplicative group is cyclic thm(very fun)
4. https://www.di.ens.fr/~pnguyen/SLIDES/SlidesLuminy2010.pdf - nice slides on LLL algorithm and more
5. http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/~mmonagan/theses/sara.pdf - algorithm of rational function reconstruction
6. Lattice construction from LLXY17 paper for fields 
7. https://hadrienj.github.io/posts/Deep-Learning-Book-Series-2.8-Singular-Value-Decomposition/ and more on SVD and pseudoinverse

What I've done:

1. A draft on how to alter the algorithm from DP19 for fields
2. A draft on how to do it for non-prime modulus(unfinished)

Currently working on:

lecture 6(D.D.) part 3, lecture 10(R.) and question 1.1 for the list below.

ToDo:

1. Answer many many questions about these algorithms:

For non-prime modulus
1.1. How to find generating set for the lattice with non-prime modulus(how to use duality here?)

For fields
1.2. How to configure parameters such that the final algorithm is efficient for fields?
1.3. How using pseudoinverses help to find basis of the lattice when matrix M is not invertible? - directly
1.4. How often matrix M is actually invertible? (irrelevant)
1.5  How many irreducible polynomials there are of degree d? +++(literature)
1.6  How to efficiently check if an element g is a genertor of a multiplicative group (Z/mZ)* for m prime number? (solved)


2. Read CR88 to see if we can use their lattice
3. Read the book on Class groups for the same reason
4. Keep reading lecture notes for more background knowledge
5. See what has to be done before I can start implementing 
6. Watch lectures from the workshop at Simons Institute?
7. Order the questions above into some kind of a plan for following weeks because at the moment I feel stuck..
