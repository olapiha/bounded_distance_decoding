# Comparing Lattice Families for Bounded Distance Decoding near Minkowskiâ€™s Bound

These are the results of my internship at CWI Amsterdam under the supervision of Leo Ducas. The internship was completed in July 2020 as a part of my first year of Masters at ENS Paris.

The report.pdf file contains all of the theoretical contributions we have made.

The files: lattice computation integers.sage and lattice computation polynomials.sage contain the programs written in SageMath that can compute the basis of a lattice defined in Section 2 and Section 3 of the report. They also contain a small commented piece of code in the end that could help one test the module.

In the files decoding integers.sage and decoding polynomials.sage you can find the implementation of the decoding algorithm discussed in the report. Similarly, you can test them by uncommenting the code at the very end of the file and changing the parameters at your wish.

In this work, I was using SageMath version 9.1 and Python 3.7.3.
