1. Why do we choose to for with this definition of density instead of vol(B(0,\lambda_1^{(p)}))/vol(L)? My guess would be it is equal up to a constant but gives simpler formulas.

> Indeed, it is a bit abusive to call lambda_1 the "density". It is nevertheless a quantity that entirely determine the density, and both quantity grows together.

2. What is the shortest vector in our lattice?

> This is the beauty of it: we do not know the shortest vector, and nevertheless we can solve BDD !

3. I am slightly confused by notation in Proposition 1 and Remark 1(page 4) small n there signifies different things is that correct?

> Indeed, it is a collision of notation. Think of n as a local variable for Proposition 1 and Remark 1.

4. Koen explained me the intuition behind Vol(L)=|Z^n/L|, should I look into a formal proof?

> It is indeed a good idea to formalize it, or search for it in leacture notes. Did you looked at my lectures with Dadush ?

5. Why LLL in 2nd dimention is exact? +

It is not LLL we do in dimension 2, but Gauss-Lagrange. You can check it out in the lecture notes as well.


6. What is the intuition behind Lemma1(page 7)? Why do we recover u, v from a lattice? It looks like very nice trick!

Well, there are many pairs (u,v) satidfying the modular equations, but only one that is short, and we want that one. Sounds like a job for a lattice !

7. It seems like there're two typos on page 8 in the end of Proposition 3(constant c is not mentioned anywhere) and where Vol(L) \geq \phi(m)(should be \leq?).

> Oops. Yes, and yes.

8.() In the proof of theorem 1 why do we take B the (n+2)nd prime isn't nth enough?

We skipped 3, because we work modulo M = 3^k, and p_i needs to be coprime with M. So we may be both wrong, and the right answer is n+1 ?

9. We are building the lattice by calculating its basis. How do we find the prime p_i that generates (Z/mZ)*?

Heuristically: try until it does. Testing wether its a geneerator is easy, right ? (left as exercise)
Formally: Hum, I have not think of that. if M where prime, I think it follows from a theorem of Bach that a short prime generator exists. for M=3^k, well, can we relate p generating (Z/MZ)* to p generating (Z/3Z)*. Hensel lifting something something ?
